An online journal which offers a model I, personally, like is: https://github.com/i-d-e.

Under https://github.com/i-d-e/ride the volumes are listed. 
 * Within each volume https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/issues/04
 * one can view each article: https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/issues/04/welschergast
 * or https://github.com/i-d-e/ride/tree/issues/09/papyri-info, for which the full tei.xml of the file is visible:
